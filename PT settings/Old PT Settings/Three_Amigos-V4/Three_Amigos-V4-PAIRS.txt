#       THE THREE AMIGOS - BUY STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.1.x
#
# This strategy is based on three of our ProfitTrailer users requests /
# suggestions in the strategy channel on the support discord. Frankensteiner
# suggested to buy on a bearish cross and sell on a bullish cross. DAOBrownie
# suggested using the MACD to do the same. And Thys suggested that the BBWIDTH
# would help with oscillating / sideways markets. So I thought I would put them all
# together and form a new strategy for everyone.
#
# Now I just happened to be watching a rerun of a particular Steve Martin, Chevy Chase,
# Martin Short movie at the time, hence the name of this strategy. Together they are
# the Three Amigos, all for one and every man for himself :-)
#
# So the Strategy buys on an uptrend using the Frankensteiner Cross, the DOABrownie
# MACD and Thys BBWIDTH. I added the STOCH and RSI to confirm the trend and its strength.
#
# It uses a short term EMACROSS indicator to track the trend. It looks
# for price rises on pairs using EMAGAIN. It then confirms the strength of the
# rise with STOCH and RSI indicators.
#
# Trailing is turned off to ensure we buy into the upward trend as soon as it
# is recognised.
#
# This strategy while it works in all market conditions is best suited to a bull market.

# *********************************************************************
#       THE THREE AMIGOS - SELL STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.1.x
#
# This strategy allows you to scalp short term upward trends.
# Note: This strategy is not quick by design it takes time and patience.
#
# This strategy does not use DCA for pairs that wont sell, instead it
# uses a dilution method using Pending Orders to clear pairs that have
# not sold in over 4 hours. It relies on having sufficient capital to
# keep purchasing pairs so that the Pending pairs will clear over time
# as more of that pair are purchased and sold.
#
# If the profit target is exceeded this strategy uses positive DCA (Anti-DCA)
# at a 5% profit target in order to improve profits by backing the winners
# and increasing our position size on the trade. It will toss the losing trades
# using Pending Orders. Note Positive DCA may put the pair at a temporary loss as
# it increases your average cost. The pending threshold in DCA compared with Pairs
# is larger for that reason.
#
# If the upward trend continues the trading pair should quickly recover from this
# loss or we will attempt to DCA in the normal manner to reduce its average cost
# and hopefully bring it back into profit or move it to a pending order if we cant
# recover it.
#
# DCA sales strategy is different to the Pairs sell strategy as with Pairs we are
# trying to get the pairs to go into DCA so we make it harder to sell as it is going up.
# Note: if you want to speed up the sales and just scalp without trying for the higher
# profits just remove the EMACROSS and just leave the GAIN in Pairs sell strategy
#
# GAIN is used to sell as soon as the current price goes above the GAIN threshold
# you set. It uses a short term EMACROSS and trailing GROW to maximise the profit.
#
# This strategy while it works in all market conditions is best suited to a bull market.
