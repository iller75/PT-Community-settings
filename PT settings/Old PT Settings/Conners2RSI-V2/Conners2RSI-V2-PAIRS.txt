#       CONNORS RSI - BUY STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.1.x
#
# This strategy implements the Connors 2 Period RSI Pullback strategy.
#
# Pullback trading is one of the most popular forms of trading amongst traders.
# It has been used in the Forex, Options, Equity and Commodities markets for many
# years by both Day Traders and Swing Traders alike.
#
# A pullback, also referred to as a retracement or consolidation, is a small temporary
# fall in a trading pairs price from its peak in a prevailing upward trend.
#
# This strategy is based on 20 years of backtesting data done in the financial markets by
# Laurence A. Connors in his book titled How Markets Work - a quantitive guide to
# Stock Market behaviour. In his susbsequent books entitled the Connors Research
# Trading Strategy Series he describes the 2 Period RSI Pullback strategy.
#
# The strategy consists of 9 basic rules, some of which we cannot directly reproduce,
# so I have had to adapt these rules to suit ProfitTrailer's current capabilities and for
# intraday trading as follows:
#
# 1. The trading pair must be in a long term uptrend according to the 200 day moving average;
# 2. The trading pair must have high volume;
# 3. The trading pair must have good volatility according to the 100 day moving average;
# 4. The trading pair must be in a strong uptrend;
# 5. The trading pair is currently down in price;
# 6. The trading pairs price must be down at least a defined percentage;
# 7. The 2 period RSI must be below 20;
# 8. Buy on a lower intraday price opportunity;
# 9. Exit the trade when the 2 period RSI is over 70.
#
# You will need to purchase his books to see the original rules if you want to compare these.
#
# This is an advanced strategy best suited to a Bear or oscillating / sideways market
# but will work in all market conditions.
