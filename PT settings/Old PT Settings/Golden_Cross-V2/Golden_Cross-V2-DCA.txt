#       GOLDEN CROSS - BUY STRATEGY - ProfitTrailer 2.1.x
#
# This strategy allows us to buy into a bullish upward trend and ride it through
# until the trend changes direction downward. It uses three EMACROSS strategies
# on the 5 minute chart using 3 different timeframes on a 5 minute chart for the
# crosses. It looks for a GOLDEN CROSS (50/200) that indicates a long term
# bullish upward trend. It confirms this with a Long Term (21/55) EMACROSS indicator
# and a Short Term (8/13) EMACROSS indicator. It then uses STOCH and RSI indicators
# to determine if we have strong sell signals and are in an overbought range
# indicating there is a strong upward trend.
#
# Trailing is turned off to ensure we buy into the upward trend as early as possible.
#
# PLEASE NOTE: This is a HIGH RISK strategy that relies on strong upward trends
# and bullish sentiment in the market. It makes use of a STOP LOSS to prevent
# significant losses from the potential to catch a falling knife when the upward
# trend reverses quickly. The possibility exists that you could lose some or all
# of your investment capital and therefore you should not invest money that you
# cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all risks associated with
# investing / trading in cryptocurrency and should seek professional financial
# advice from an independent,competent, licensed accountant or financial advisor.
#
# This strategy is good for high volatility Bull and sideways market conditions.
#
#          RIDE THE TREND, TOSS THE LOSERS AND BACK THE WINNERS

#
# This strategy looks for a reversal of the short term trend
# indicator to determine if the upward trend has completed its cycle.
# If the profit target is exceeded and we are still on an upward trend
# it then uses positive DCA (Anti-DCA) at a 4% profit target in order to
# improve profits by backing the winners and increasing our position size
# on the trade. It will toss the losing trades using a stop loss. The stop
# loss is also there to pick up any sudden trend reversals to prevent catching
# a falling knife. Note Positive DCA may put the pair at a temporary loss as
# it increases your average cost. If the upward trend continues the trading
# pair should quickly recover from this loss or we will attempt to DCA in
# the normal manner to reduce its average cost and hopefully bring it back
# into profit or stop it out if we cant recover it.
# GAIN is used to sell as soon as the current price goes above the GAIN threshold
# you set.
